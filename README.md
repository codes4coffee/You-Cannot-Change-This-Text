Try to change that text.

Well... you probably still can. The goal isn't exactly to make it impossible, but to make it much more difficult than it would normally be.

## But Why Though?

I got the idea for this project from those YouTube videos where people troll phone scammers. One of their tactics is to make you think money was transfered into your back account that you need to send back. They do this by poping into inspect element and modifying one of your statement line items to look like a deposit. I thought it would be fun to see exactly how difficult I could make it for someone to manipulate text in the DOM.
